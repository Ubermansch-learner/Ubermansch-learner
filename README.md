- 👋 Hi, I’m Suman Swain
- 👀 I’m learning and experimenting in the field of full-stack development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in web development where code meets amazing UI because 'Jo Dikhta Hai Vahi Bikta Hai', i.e., whatever is dear to our eyes gets sold out easily.
- 📫 You can mail me for collaborations and work-related stuff.
  ⚡ Fun fact: You will find me watching spiritual videos on YouTube in my free time. I am a little emotional person and I love it when people express their thoughts and ideas running in their mind. Also, my friends and dear ones call me an introvert and I think they are right. Our life is a blessing and we should live to its fullest but be kind, loving, respectful, and soft-spoken. That's a lot of gyaanbaazi(throwing my point of view) though!
